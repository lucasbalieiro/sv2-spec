In case the `*.png` files on the parent directory need to be adjusted, the `*.drawio.xml` files from this directory 
should be imported into the `draw.io` online tool for editing.

- export the `.png` file to replace the old one in the parent directory
- export the `.drawio.xml` file to replace the old one on this directory
